				<p>Core goals behind each design decision we made.</p>

				<p>The objective of our project was to create a robot, inspired by a snake, that takes
					measurements to evaluate soil. We designed it to be used in the context of evaluating
					risk of forest fire. The equipped sensor is therefore a moisture sensor, and
					measurements map to the user's dashboard so that they can see areas with dry soil.
					We drew inspiration from snakes in terms of the three styles of motion that the
					snake performs, all exhibited by species of snakes.

				<h2>Skin</h2>
				<p>From the beginning we knew we would need a flexible, yet water and dirt resistent outer shell for our
					snake to protect the internal components from the elements. At first, we were going to use burlap
					because
					of its natural fibers and durability, but after buying burlap, we realized there were too many holes
					and loose
					fibers. It also seemed constricting to just have a fabric enclose our snake like a sock.

						<h3>Origami Iterations</h3>
						<p>
							We were able to take inspiration from origami to try and create a round shape that could
							also stretch and compress.
							The image to the right shows our iteration of different fold patterns, starting from a flat
							pattern that could
							stretch and compress into a cylindrical shape.

						<h3>Feasibility</h3>
						<p>
							Once we found a fold pattern that would fit our snake, we wanted to test
							if the skin could stretch and compress enough to allow for the snake's
							movements. We also wanted to test attachment methods, so we put a tab on the
							paper skin and connected to two links and watched the vertical and horizontal
							movement. As seen in the videos, the skin was able to stretch to the snake's
							maximum rotation and compress back into the original pattern.

						<h3>Making the Skin</h3>
						<p>
							Obviously, paper would not be a durable material for the snake's skin, 
							so we tried two alternatives. The first was leather, which when you soak
							in water and then let dry, becomes stiff and will hold a pattern. However, 
							leather was thick and hard to get into the right shape. Once we had it in
							the right shape, it wouldn't sustain the weight of the snake, it would just 
							collapse on itself.

				<p>The other option we tried was taking a cotton bedsheet, drawing the fold 
					pattern on to it, and then applying glue onto each individual triangle, 
					leaving the fold lines unglued so it wouldn't become stiff. While time 
					consuming, this gave us the stiff panels we needed while still being 
					flexible and water resistant.
